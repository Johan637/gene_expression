## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data_CD630 = read.csv("GSE173804_CD630_raw_data.csv")
data_196 = read.csv("GSE173804_196_raw_data.csv")
data_196
```
